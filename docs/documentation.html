index.html: main file, access to all cases included. Simple webpage with lateral panel displaying all cases implemented; and an iframe where the case is loaded.

Cases: each case analyzed and implemented in the program is developed independently, so each one has a common structure in an independent subfolder. The subfolder structure is mainly

- caseName
  |_ includes
  |_ caseName.htm

caseName.htm corresponds to the webpage loaded into the iframe in the main html file, which include the references to the necessary javascript files.

Includes contains all the javascript files relevant to the particular case, such as results, nodal positions and other functions that are used only locally.

Css: folder containing css style files used in the webpages.

Js: folder containing common javascript files to all pages and cases. Divided into two subfolders:
•	Core: include the core libraries needed for the program to run (i.e., THREE library, jQuery, dat.GUI).
•	Misc: includes common functions to be used in different cases, such as linear algebra, common animation functions and others.

Resources: folder with extra resources for the webpage such as icons, images and fonts.
